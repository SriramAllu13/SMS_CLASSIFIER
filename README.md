# TextClassify

##  Introduction
I'm excited to share my latest project â€“ a powerful Machine Learning Model with an impressive 98% accuracy! ðŸ“Š.

This model has been meticulously trained to distinguish between Spam and Non spam messages of text and image provided.

Accepts either text or image as a input and classifies the message as spam or non-spam.

## Project Highlights
âœ¨ Support Vector Magic: Harnessing the power of Support Vector Classification (SVC), this model has been meticulously trained to distinguish between Spam and Non spam messages of text provided.The Support Vector Classification model carves out optimal decision boundaries by identifying support vectors, which are crucial data points that help define the separation between  Spam and Non spam message classes. The model aims to maximize the margin between these classes, leading to a robust and accurate classification.

ðŸ§  Smart Learning with NLTK: Harnessing the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), the model is equipped with advanced NLP techniques, allowing it to understand and analyze the nuances of human language. NLTK's rich set of tools facilitates robust pre-processing and feature extraction.

ðŸŽ¯ High Accuracy: The classifier achieved a staggering 98% accuracy during testing, demonstrating its efficacy in distinguishing between  Spam and Non spam messages. This high accuracy ensures reliable performance in real-world scenarios.

## How it Works
1.Text Classification: You can enter a text message, and the app will analyze it to determine whether it is spam or a normal message based on its content.

2.Image Input: Upload an image containing text, and the app will extract the text from the image and classify it accordingly.

3.Feedback: Provide feedback to help improve the accuracy and functionality of the application.

## Algorithms Used
1.Naive Bayes

2.Random Forest Classifier

3.Kneighbours Classifier

4.Support Vector Classifier

5.Logistic Regression

Out of the above 5 mentioned algorithms Support Vector Algorithm Stood at top with an astounding 98% accuracy.

Random Forest Classifier also did well with an accuracy of 97%.

## App Features
User-Friendly Interface: The Streamlit app provides an intuitive interface for users to input messages and receive instant predictions on whether they are Spam or Non spam.

Accessible Anytime, Anywhere: Once deployed, the app is accessible from any device with an internet connection, allowing you to showcase your classifier to a wider audience.

High accuracy classification using advanced machine learning models.
